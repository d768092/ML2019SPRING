# ML 2019 SPRING Final Project

## Toolkit Version

```python
numpy 1.16.3
jieba 0.39
gensim 3.7.2
pandas 0.24.2
pip 19.0.3
```

## How To Execute

&emsp; We've pretrain all of data. If you want to get the result without preprocessing, just run the following command. We assume that after you run the `download.sh`, all of data are placed in the directory where you run the bash file. You will get a output file `sample_output.csv`

```bash
sh download.sh
python3 retrieval_example.py
```
